A script to automatically skip anime opening and ending sequences, making it easier to watch your favorite shows without having to manually skip the intros and outros each time.
  this script is an extension for ani-cli, but there's a chance it may support other anime clis, it's also best to use it with mpv since that's what it supports the most.
